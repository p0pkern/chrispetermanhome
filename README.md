# Chris Peterman's Homepage

Hello,

I'm Chris Peterman. If you are stumbling on to this Github repository and this website then I have probably applied to your company as a software engineer. This is a site to showcase my abilities and some of the projects I am proud of. I plan to add more and expand on the site as I learn and create more.

## About the Page

I created the website with React.js. I used react-routes-dom to transition between the pages for an asyncronous single page application, the majority of the functionality is done throug React hooks, and the animations on the homepage are randomly generated and randomly positioned utilizing hooks and CSS.
