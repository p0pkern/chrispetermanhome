# Portfolio Website of Chris Peterman

This is a website for hosting my personal projects and a short blurb about myself.
The technologies used are React.js, React-Router, JavaScript.

## About the Page

### The Home Page

- The main landing page is designed with a large logo in the center and an animation or orbs that float up from the bottom of the page upward.
- Each of the orbs is generated randomly in size, coloration, and speed of animation. They each float at a random interval from below the footer over the logo and into the top portion, where they disappear and then regenerate.

### The Projects Page

- Each project is developed as a card with the required information organized and displayed in a list on the projects page. The projects card is designed to be scalable and expandable for any number of projects that I want to display.
- To add some more depth to displaying the projects I decided the image should be a Gif of the main portion of the projects.

### The About Page

- This page is a simple static page in order to showcase more about myself.
